Congratulations, you have successfully installed SoftSlate Commerce!

(In the unlikely event you have to run the installer again, you must first empty the database and then edit the WEB-INF/classes/appSettings.properities file located under the SoftSlate Commerce installation directory. Look for the line beginning "lockInstaller", and delete that line.)
